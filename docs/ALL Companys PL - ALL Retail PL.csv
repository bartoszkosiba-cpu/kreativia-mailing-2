Wtedy to szukając pomysłu na kawalerski, przyszedł pomysł zagrania w piłkę w dmuchanych kulach Bumper ball (Bubble Football, Bubble Soccer). Obsługując rozmaite eventy z piłkami po pewnym czasie narodził się pomysł, aby kupić pierwsze dmuchańce i cóż… Nasz dostawca nasz oszukał i nie okazał się uczciwy, a my straciliśmy pieniądze. Dużo pieniędzy. Nie poddaliśmy się! Spróbowaliśmy jeszcze raz z innymi dostawcami i udało się! Wszystko było właśnie takie jak być powinno, a dmuchańce cieszyły się ogromną popularnością, dlatego też w następnym roku znów kupiliśmy kolejne!
Krok po kroku, zdobywając coraz większe doświadczenie w wynajmie dmuchanych atrakcji oraz dokupując kolejne dmuchańce ( całą naszą ofertę znajdziecie na www.funandplay.pl ) poznaliśmy tajniki tego biznesu na wylot, a w naszych głowach narodził się pomysł sprzedawania i pomagania osobom takim jak my kilka lat temu, bez narażania Was na ryzyko utraty pieniędzy, problemów z jakością atrakcji, gwarancją, dostawą oraz ukrytymi opłatami, o których kilka lat temu nie mieliśmy pojęcia, że w ogóle istnieją!

Teraz z czystym sumieniem możemy Wam oferować dmuchane zjeżdżalnie, zamki do skakania, skakańce z suchymi basenami, dmuchane place zabaw w różnych rozmiarach, tory przeszkód, dmuchane urządzenia do rywalizacji jak wipeout, parki rozrywki, parki wodne, atrakcje na wodę, a nawet dmuchane poduszki do skoków!
Masz pomysł na jakiś szalony dmuchaniec? Chcesz zmienić kolory danej atrakcji? Wszystkie nasze dmuchane atrakcje mają możliwość personalizacji i dostosowania do Twoich potrzeb!

W 1979 roku, gdy otworzył swój pierwszy sklep w drugim co do wielkości mieście w Danii - Arhus - gdzie, nawiasem mówiąc, sklep nadal istnieje - Larsen miał wielkie ambicje, ale nawet nie przypuszczał, że jego firma tak szybko się rozwinie. Larsen z powodzeniem otworzył kilka sklepów JYSK Sengetøjslager (oryginalna nazwa sklepu do 2001 roku) w całej Danii, a w 1984 roku otworzył pierwszy sklep za granicą, w sąsiednich Niemczech. 

Obecnie grupa JYSK obejmuje 2.200 sklepów w wymienionych poniżej 37 krajach na całym świecie. W Danii, Norwegii, Szwecji, Finlandii, Polsce, w Republice Czeskiej, na Węgrzech, w Holandii, na Słowacji, w Niemczech, Austrii, Szwajcarii, Islandii, Kanadzie, Grenlandii, na Wyspach Owczych, w Estonii, Łotwie, Litwie, na Ukrainie, w Kosowie, Bułgarii, Kazachstanie, Rumunii, Francji, w Wielkiej Brytanii, Słowenii, Macedonii, Chorwacji, we Włoszech, w Hiszpanii, Bośni i Hercegowinie, Chiny, Serbia, Armenia, Indonezji i Czarnogóra.

Roczny obrót grupy wynosi około 2,8 miliardów €. Wzrost jest stały i kontrolowany, a zatrudnionych jest około 19.000 pracowników. 

Słowo „JYSK"" było zawsze celowo używane w nazwie firmy. W języku duńskim słowo „JYSK"" oznacza coś lub - jak Lars Larsen - kogoś z Półwyspu Jutlandzkiego i jest często kojarzone ze skromnością, dokładnością i uczciwością - trzema wartościami, które Larsen zawsze identyfikował z JYSK oznaczające wiarygodność i solidność.",,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66ed3e61a453650001aed844/picture,JYSK (jysk.com),,,,,,,

The brand creators' experience in marketing, design and production of handmade glass winter ornaments dates back to the early 1990s. They learned the industry in the Polish glassblowing district of Złotoryja, working for the largest glassblowing factories in the country.

Since the end of the 90s they participated in the world's most important trade fair for the Christmas decorations sector, Christmasworld, dedicated to Christmas and Easter decorations, where they learned about expectations, trends and established relationships with international distributors of Christmas decorations. Thus, in 2007 CELTIC brand was established, in which Iwona Jaworska is responsible for marketing and management, and Zbigniew Baranowski - for production part, developing forms and new designs of ornaments.

In the Christmas tree ornament factory located in Leszno all manufactured glass ornaments are entirely hand-made. First, designs are born in the mind, sometimes they are consulted with major distributors. This is a complicated process, which requires a great deal of experience in glass processing and artistic sense, followed by meticulous manual work by talented decorators.

In this way unique works of art are created, which are a delightful decoration of any space. The main range of CELTIC brand consists of Christmas and Easter decorations. Within them you can find both the classic, round glass ornaments, as well as landscape ornaments, glass figurines, through to exclusive Christmas decorations in the shape of eggs a'la Faberge finished with original Swarovski stones. CELTIC's offer already includes several thousand patterns of glass baubles!

Today, CELTIC is a brand well known and valued in the domestic and foreign branch of Christmas decorations distributors.",2007,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/67078e61e1389e0001c52d70/picture,,,,,,,,

Dzięki temu są to produkty najwyższej jakości, ale też unikatowe i doskonałe na tyle, że mogą być przekazywane z pokolenia na pokolenie, bez problemu wytrzymując upływ czasu i wieloletnie użytkowanie. Do produkcji biżuterii używamy unikalnego stopu złota, który został stworzony dla naszych potrzeb i zapewnia wyjątkowo piękny odcień kruszcu, jak i imponującą wytrzymałość.

Kamienie szlachetne sprowadzamy tylko ze sprawdzonych źródeł, dodatkowo są one weryfikowane przez specjalistyczne maszyny oraz wprawne oczy naszych ekspertów. Staramy się również, żeby nasze brylanty charakteryzowały się ponadprzeciętną jakością. Wychodząc naprzeciw pragnieniom naszych klientów tworzymy również inną biżuterię niż flagowa Premium Handmade, jak choćby modele inspirowane pięknem włoskich miast czy autorskie kolekcje ze srebra. Dodatkowo importujemy również biżuterię z Włoch, m.in. z Mediolanu, stolicy designu.

Jesteśmy pewni jakości naszych wyrobów, dlatego objęte są one bezterminowym serwisem.",,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/691008146c531e000113ae9a/picture,,,,,,,,

Dzięki dużej różnorodności naszych rozwiązań, każde specyficzne wymaganie klienta w zakresie monitoringu może być dostosowane indywidualnie. 

Nasza technologia nadzoru pozwala na kontrolę dużych obszarów jak place budowy, tereny komercyjne czy miejsca imprez. Obszary trudno dostępne i częste zmiany lokalizacji nadzoru nie stanowią żadnego problemu. Wieże łączą się z wieloma zdalnymi czujnikami, dzięki czemu rejestrują zdarzenia w czasie rzeczywistym. Mogą być wyposażone w panele słoneczne. W ten sposób stanowią odnawialne źródło energii. 

Oferujemy również produkty kontroli dostępu dla branży budowlanej, takie jak kontenery portierskie z kołowrotkami lub same kołowrotki wejściowe. Firmy budowlane mogą uniknąć strat instalując właściwe ogrodzenia i kołowrotki.

The main mission of this venture is to introduce viewers to a new trend in art, which is digital painting and graphics. Additionally, it is intended to change a present-day image of computer artists. The organizers have made it their goal to set new standards of measuring the author's achievements. The digital artist should be evaluated on his artistic work and on the number of exhibitions in which he participated rather than by the long list of his corporate clients.
The organizers present the works of people whose names do not appear on the pages of auction catalogs and whose works cannot be seen in museums. The subjective selection of works is intended to reflect a broad spectrum of modern digital graphics, its interests and topics.
In the interest of collectors, all the sculptures and graphic works have been prepared especially for the art market. Images were prepared using fine-art giclée print, on canvas designed for high quality digital printing (Ilford about 340g). Such procedure allows to obtain the best quality print while maintaining perfect color palette for decades. Designed by the creators, the sculptures themselves were manufactured using high-precision spatial printing capabilities (CJP and SLS). Selected technologies provide exceptional quality details.

Each work has been produced in a limited edition, in a small batch. Five copies of the print were described with a number, a handwritten signature of the author and marked with a unique hologram. The transaction data will be incorporated into an online list of bitcoin contracts (blockchain). Protected works not only have a unique collectible value but also are a great investment .",2014,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66ecf77a8161e70001698555/picture,,,,,,,,

Combining luxurious materials from all over the world with timeless design and real functionality, all Branik pieces are individually designed and created in our Warsaw atelier. From serving trays and display bowls to incense holders and vases, each Branik object is a beautiful and useful distillation of the features inherent to stone. Working in marble, travertine, onyx, quartzite, and other noble materials, we typically combine separate pieces of one stone type or of several into more than the sum of the parts. 

Our brand purpose is to celebrate the satisfying density and remarkable beauty of natural stone. By selecting the ideal stone slabs, applying the perfect cuts, and featuring layering and intarsia, we allow the light to reveal the material's essence. Whether as a gift for the one who has everything or as a family treasure for the generations, Branik translates the perfect solidity of natural rock into functional objects that bring joy and embody harmony.

Branik has been featured in Vogue Poland, House & Garden UK, the Hamptons magazine, and the interior design of the Maybourne Beverly Hills hotel.

Branik Delight is a family business founded in 2020 by acclaimed Polish architect and interior designer Agata Knorowska, a Warsaw Academy of Arts graduate.  Recognizing the value and scarcity of a luxury medium formed millions of years ago, we practice responsible sourcing and cutting of stone. We work in marble, onyx, travertine, quartzite, and other luxurious rocks, which we source from all over the world. Envisioning how each individual stone slab will be used is a major part of our less-waste design process, which includes consideration for both functionality and appearance.",2020,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66d83d1b53e41a0001c92723/picture,,,,,,,,

We make a good team open to innovation, art and people. In particular, we appreciate our offer of furniture made of used wine barrels. This is the third life for wood. Our barrels are made of the noblest species of oak – the king of all trees. Oak refines the wine, gives it smoothness and class. We want to keep the oak's role alive in our projects. Our designers are constantly working on new designs. We also listen with great attention to the voice of our customers.

DUE became a sales representative of the world's leader in wine cellar design and production in Poland. The holding includes three companies: Sorrells Wineracks Ltd; The Traditional Winerack Co Ltd; Carlo Garn. Since 1947, our Partner has gained extensive experience in the market. Customers in Poland will be able to create their own wine cellar based on the experience of both our Partner and DUE in designing furniture, unique collections made of wine barrels and old wood.

Furthermore, we design and manufacture furniture of old wood, whose origin is equally intriguing. It comes from old barns, wooden houses, Catholic and Orthodox churches located in Galicia, i.e. the region of south-eastern Poland and western Ukraine. In the 19th century, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, forgotten today, used to be located here with its capital in Lviv and later in Cracow. Noble wood tells the history of people who inhabited this land – beautiful and severe, mysterious and inspiring. The Carpathian Mountains are also defined by art cultivated here for a thousand years. We strived to keep the spirit of this land alive in our projects. 

Contemporary trends in interior design, in which rustic, vintage elements are combined with modernism, have become our inspiration. Such projects are often a blend of: old wood, solid rock and glass. 

Wir sind eine polnische Firma, die sich mit Möbeln aus Fässern und altem Holz befasst. Wir bilden eine teamorientierte Mannschaft, die auf Innovation, moderne Designtrends, Stil und Kunst offen ist. Besonders schätzen wir unser Angebot an Möbeln aus alten Weinfässern. Es bedeutet das dritte Leben eines Baumes. Die Fässer werden aus edelstem Eichenholz gefertigt und die Eiche ist eine Königin aller Bäume. Die Eiche veredelt den Wein, verleiht ihm Glattheit und Klasse. Wir wollen, dass die Rolle der Eiche in unseren Projekten aufrechterhalten wird. Unsere Designer arbeiten ständig an neuen Lösungen, wir beachten auch mit großer Aufmerksamkeit die Meinungen unserer Kunden.

Zu unseren Inspirationen wurden moderne Trends der Innenraugestaltung, bei denen rustikale, Vintage-Elemente mit modernen verbunden werden. Oft sind in unseren Projekten Melangen von altem Holz, massiven Felsen und Glas zu bemerken. Eklektische Formen sind bei solchen Innenräumen und Gärten auch nicht fremd. Vintage-Stilistik, aber auch provenzalisches Design und gewisse Kontexte des skandinavischen Stils, sind oft auftretende Motive des modernen Innenraum- und Gartenarrangements.

Jesteśmy pasjonatami pięknych wnętrz! Odwiedź nasz salon w Bydgoszczy!!! Kurpińskiego 12/5a Office@castor-studio.pl

Jesteśmy firmą rodzinną i od 1990 roku zajmujemy się posadzkami – początkowo jako importer i dostawca wykładzin dywanowych i PCV do sklepów i sieci domów handlowych, a od 1996 roku realizujemy zamówienia projektowe i inwestycyjne zarówno dla obiektów użyteczności publicznej jak i dla klientów indywidualnych.
Wraz z rozwojem naszej firmy poszerzyliśmy ofertę o produkty do zastosowania na ścianach. I tak, do oferowanych produktów włączyliśmy farby, tynki ozdobne, tapety oraz listwy sztukateryjne i wykończeniowe do ścian.
Staramy się, aby w naszym salonie można było kompleksowo zakupić materiały do wykończenia podłóg i ścian.
Mamy wykształcenie budowlane, dlatego staramy się naszym klientom pomagać w podejmowaniu, czasami trudnych decyzji związanych np. z  tematem remontów posadzek i ścian, czy wyboru odpowiedniego rodzaju pokryć do konkretnego pomieszczenia. Jesteśmy do tego przygotowani… Wykonujemy również projekty aranżacji i rozwiązań posadzek i ścian.
Naszymi partnerami handlowymi i dostawcami są renomowani producenci w swoich branżach. Dzięki nim możemy zaoferować Państwu doskonałe materiały i najnowsze technologie. Wśród oferowanych przez nas produktów są zarówno materiały z „najwyższej półki"" – ekskluzywne i niepowtarzalne, dla bardzo wymagającego klienta, jak i te po przystępnych cenach.
W obu przypadkach kierowała nami idea doboru produktów oryginalnych i dobrych jakościowo.
W naszej działalności współpracujemy z architektami i dekoratorami wnętrz co sprawia, że doskonałe rozwiązania w projektach, z naszą pomocą, pozwalają inwestorowi zrealizować efektowny, niepowtarzalny projekt na wysokim poziomie jakości i w najlepszych cenach.
Zapraszamy  Państwa  do  odwiedzenia  naszego  salonu… W każdym temacie związanym z posadzką czy wykończeniem wnętrz jesteśmy do Państwa dyspozycji.",1993,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66ea91910e5fcb0001520d6d/picture,,,,,,,,

The collection of posters by the best Polish artists from the ""Polish School of Posters"" - a phenomenon from the mid-twentieth century.

We hope that we can reach to many customers who are tired of modern mass-pressed reproductions for the needs of DIY stores and furniture stores.

Art poster can be ugly called a product, but even then it is something that has depth and some greater sense, for example because of its wider context of origin and history.

In short, the Polish poster has character.


The company Plakat Polski was established in 1984.

# We guarantee that you are purchasing original prints

All our posters on offer are original prints or reprints made in the 60-80s at the request of DESA foreign trade company or the Plakat Polski (starting from 1984).

#We provide comprehensive custom services

On special request, all our posters are framed in aluminum frames with plexiglass, backs and accessories for hanging on the wall.

We offer standard aluminum frames 100x70cm for the B1 size or 61x91cm for the A1 size.

We also carry out special orders with frames to size, large passe-partout and non-standard forms of luminaires.

Additionally, we also offer a special advisory service when building a poster collection.

We carry out orders for comprehensive planning of wall decorations in office and residential spaces.

#We guarantee the perfect condition of the posters

We store all our posters flat, in piles, which protects them against mechanical damage and the negative influence of light.

We deliver shipments in cardboard tubes with a minimum diameter of 52 millimeters.

Posters we sell are the slice of authentic polish culture and heritage so thin that you can actually hang it on the wall",1984,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66dd09c71e39c20001d73685/picture,,,,,,,,
